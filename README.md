# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this dataset is to figure out how different campaigns are managed about their launch dates and their funding goals. It also helps to research projects with a similar monetary goal which will help Louise find out the trend of the successes. The visualization of the data will help to analyze the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. Louise is estimating that her play will cost $12,000. By doing this project, we can identify the relationship between the success percentage of pledging and the goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The graph attached below explains the trend of the campaign outcomes based on their launch months. It clearly shows that the number of successful outcomes are higher than both the failed and cancelled campaigns throughout all months. The count of successful outcomes is depicted as gray in the graph, while the failed outcomes is orange, and the number of canceled outcomes is blue. The number of successful outcomes has the widest range, varying from 37 in December to 111 in the month of May. In contrast, the failed campaign outcomes are in a significantly smaller range between 33 and 50. In the months of January, June, July and October all had almost the same number of failed campaigns launched. The number of canceled outcomes never exceeds 7 per month which is depicted as a relatively constant blue line in the graph. Overall,the highest number of outcomes occurred in the month of May .

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Graph attached below explains the trend of the outcomes based on the goals. The percentage os successes of the campaigns are higher in the lower goal amount range. If the goal is less than $4999, It has a higher percentage of success. The percentage of canceled plays is at 0% on any goal amount. For the failed campaigns, in the lower ranges of goal amount which would be around $3000, there are less chances of failures. It shows if the goal amount is more than $45000, its a clear failure.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 The months with the most successes are May  and June. 
 The months with the most failures are mainly January, March and November.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
After completing this project, the trend of successes is pretty consistent and evident. What triggers the success and causes the failures of the campaigns is not that clear. But if you want to choose the safer choice, it should be lower goal amount range which is less than $4999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is another outcome which is live. In my opinion that category should not be there. It should fall into successful or canceled. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Bar chart: percentage success vs. failure 
A box plot that helps identify all the outliers in the dataset as well as the median amount.
