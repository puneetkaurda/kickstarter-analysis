# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This dataset aims to determine how different campaigns are managed regarding their launch dates and funding goals. The data will help Lousie determine the success rate of her campaign based on other projects with similar monetary goals listed in the dataset. The data visualization helps analyze the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the campaign's funding goal amount. Louise is estimating that her play will cost $12,000. By looking at the visualization of the data, we can identify the relationship between the success percentage of pledging and the goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The graph shown below explains the campaign outcomes trend based on their launch months. This data visualization clearly shows that the number of successful outcomes is higher than the failed and canceled campaigns throughout all months. The count of successful outcomes is depicted as gray in the graph, while the failed outcomes are orange, and the number of canceled outcomes is blue. The number of successful outcomes has the widest range, varying from 37 in December to 111 in May. In contrast, the failed campaign outcomes are in a significantly smaller range from 33 to 50. January, June, July, and October have almost the same number of failed campaigns. The number of canceled outcomes never exceeds 7 per month, shown in the graph as a relatively continuous blue line. Overall, the highest number of successful campaign outcomes occurred in the month of May(111 campaigns).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The graph below explains the outcomes' trend based on the goals. The percentage of successes of the campaigns is higher in the lower goal amount range. If the goal is less than $4999, it has a higher percentage of success. The percentage of canceled plays is at 0% on any goal amount. For the failed campaigns, there are fewer chances of failures in the lower ranges of the goal amount, which would be around $3000. The graph shows if the goal amount is more than $45000, it's a clear failure.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What conclusions can you draw about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date?
 The months with the most successes are May and June. 
 The months with the most failures are January, March, and November.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
After completing this project, I concluded that the success trend is consistent and evident. What triggers the success and causes the failures of the campaigns is not that clear. But if you want to choose the safer choice, it should be a lower goal amount range of less than $4999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset also lists another outcome, a live campaign. Since a live campaign means that there isn't any outcome yet, this category doesn't fall under successful, failed, or even canceled. The data visualizations only show successful, canceled, and failed play campaigns, meaning that the live category does not necessarily have to be listed in the dataset. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Bar chart: Percentage Success vs. Failure when the goal is $12,000
This bar chart will give Lousie a better insight into the outcome of her own campaign. This type of data visualization will help Louise roughly determine her percentage of success when she decides to set a goal of $12,000 for her campaign.
